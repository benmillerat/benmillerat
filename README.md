# Hey, I'm Ben 👋

I tackle problems with bits and turn ideas into tools that help make complex software more accessible.

Former Technology Journalist and in Tech PR for Apple, Qualcomm, Accenture (AI), Nothing, Nikon; now aspiring Agentic Engineer, developing AI agent integrations, and open-source tools straight outta Munich.

## Interests

- **AI Agents & Automation** – Running [🦞 OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw) in production, building skills and integrations
- **CLIs & Developer Tools** – Making APIs usable for humans
- **3D Printing** — Shaping ideas and turning them into matter; designing functional parts in Fusion 360. Check it out on [Printables](https://www.printables.com/@bensen) and [Makerworld](https://makerworld.com/en/@bensen).
- **Homelab** — Proxmox cluster, self-hosted infrastructure
- **Open Source** — Because the best tools are the ones everyone can use

## What I'm Working On

🦞 **[OpenClaw Sub-Agent Data Exchange](https://gist.github.com/benmillerat/0fc51c8d5cff41fea59505ccdca32c32)** – Filesystem-First Sub-Agent Data Exchange Architecture for OpenClaw 

🎬 **[openclaw-youtube-archiver](https://github.com/benmillerat/openclaw-youtube-archiver)** — OpenClaw skill that archives YouTube playlists as markdown notes with AI summaries, transcripts, and auto-tags. Multi-provider (OpenAI, Gemini, Anthropic, Ollama), works without any API keys. [Available on ClawHub](https://clawhub.ai).

🛒 **[supermarket-deals](https://github.com/benmillerat/supermarket-deals)** — OpenClaw skill that tracks product deals at German supermarkets (Aldi, Lidl, REWE, EDEKA, Kaufland) via Marktguru. Results ranked by best price per litre (EUR/L), weekly cron notifications via Telegram or iMessage. [Available on ClawHub](https://clawhub.ai/benmillerat/supermarket-deals).

🔧 **[productboard-cli](https://github.com/benmillerat/productboard-cli)** — The first open-source CLI for the Productboard API. 144 commands, full v1 + v2 beta coverage. Built because product managers deserve better tooling.

🔌 **[productboard-mcpb](https://github.com/benmillerat/productboard-mcpb)** — One-click Productboard connector for Claude Desktop. Double-click install, no terminal needed.

💡 **[ideaflow](https://github.com/benmillerat/ideaflow)** — Lightweight idea management for [🦞 OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw) agents. Capture ideas from spark to shipped.

## Background

I spent a decade in tech journalism, moved on to tech communications, from running one of the largest Apple blogs in the German-speaking world to helping Apple PR Germany launch Apple Silicon and Apple TV+ in the DACH market, then Qualcomm Compute and Accenture in DACH at Burson.

Along the way I realized the tools I wished existed... didn't. So I started building them.
