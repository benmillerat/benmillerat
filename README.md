# Hey, I'm Ben 👋

I conquer problems with bits and turn ideas into tools that help make complex software more accessible to everyone.

Former Technology Journalist and in Tech PR for Apple, Qualcomm, Accenture (AI), Nothing, Nikon; now aspiring Agentic Engineer, developing AI agent integrations, and open-source tools straight outta Munich.

## Interests

- **AI Agents & Automation** — Running [🦞 OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw) in production, building skills and integrations
- **CLIs & Developer Tools** — Making APIs usable for humans
- **3D Printing** — Shaping ideas and turning them into matter; designing functional parts in Fusion 360. Check it out on [Printables](https://www.printables.com/@bensen) and [Makerworld](https://makerworld.com/en/@bensen).
- **Homelab** — Proxmox cluster, self-hosted infrastructure
- **Open Source** — Because the best tools are the ones everyone can use

## What I'm Working On

🔧 **[productboard-cli](https://github.com/benmillerat/productboard-cli)** — The first open-source CLI for the Productboard API. 144 commands, full v1 + v2 beta coverage. Built because product managers deserve better tooling.

🔌 **[productboard-mcpb](https://github.com/benmillerat/productboard-mcpb)** — One-click Productboard connector for Claude Desktop. Double-click install, no terminal needed.

💡 **[ideaflow](https://github.com/benmillerat/ideaflow)** — Lightweight idea management for [🦞 OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw) agents. Capture ideas from spark to shipped.

## Background

I spent a decade in tech journalism, switched side to tech communications, from running one of the largest Apple blogs in the German-speaking world to helping launch Apple Silicon and Apple TV+ in the DACH market, then Qualcomm Compute in DACH at Burson.

Along the way I realized the tools I wished existed... didn't. So I started building them.
